# FriendFinder
This app is meant for a user to find a potential 'player 2' for games based on common game interests. It does not use a database to store information but rather adds new users to an array of 'Friends'. A user answers a survey on gameing interests and their ideal gaming partner with the closest interests will pop-up at the end.
